# Regression-Tree-ML

This repository contains an implementation of the Regression Tree algorithm, a decision tree-based method for predicting continuous values in supervised learning tasks.

## Features

Implementation of Regression Trees for continuous target prediction.

Step-by-step code with detailed comments for better understanding.

Handles splitting criteria using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE).

Includes a sample dataset for demonstration.

Visualization of the decision tree structure and prediction results (if applicable).

## Technologies Used:

Python

NumPy

Matplotlib (for visualizations)

Scikit-learn (optional, for comparisons or dataset utilities)

## Applications:

Predicting continuous outcomes like house prices or stock values.

Understanding tree-based regression models.

Building the foundation for advanced tree-based algorithms like Random Forests and Gradient Boosted Trees.
